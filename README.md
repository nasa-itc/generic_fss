# Generic Fine Sun Sensor - NOS3 Component
This repository contains the NOS3 Generic Fine Sun Sensor Component.
This includes flight software (fsw), ground software (gsw), and simulation(sim) directories.

## Overview
The generic fine sun sensor is an SPI device that accepts a command to retrieve the sun angles and returns the sun angles and an error code.
The available flight software is for use in the core Flight System (cFS) while the ground software supports COSMOS.
A NOS3 simulation is available which uses a 42 data provider.

# Hardware Component Technical Specifications
Angles reading
- Sensor type:  2 axes
- Field of view (FOV):  +/- 60 degrees

## Mechanical
### Reference System
The +z axis is perpendicular to the sensor diodes.  The +x axis is aligned with the long part of the sensor body and is stamped on the body.  The +y axis is aligned with the short part of the sensor body and is stamped on the body.  The x, y, and z axis make a mutually orthogonal, right hand coordinate system.  

Given that the sun unit vector in the sensor coordinate system is (xa, ya, za), the sensor reads out angles alpha and beta, where alpha is the angle from the +z axis in the x-z plane and beta is the angle from the +z axis in the y-z plane.  In other words, for the given unit vector (xa, ya, za):
- tan(alpha) = xa/za
- tan(beta) = ya/za.

## Communications
The NOS3 Generic Fine Sun Sensor Component can communicate via the SPI protocol.

### Data Format
The data structure for communications is explained below:
- Character transmission (unsigned char):  (Byte_0(LSB)) --> to communications channel
- Floating data transmission (float):  Float codification according to IEEE 754-1985 standard for single-precision floating 32 bits:  (sign|exponent|fraction) = (Byte_3(MSB)|Byte_2|Byte_1|Byte_0(LSB)) --> to communications channel
    - Floating value = s x 2^e x m, where:
        - Sign(s): 1 bit (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
        - Exponent: 8 bits (e = Exponent - 127)
        - Fraction: 23 bits (m = 1.Fraction)

### Frame Format
This protocol uses two messages:
- Request message: from master to slave
- Response message: from slave to master

The master is the on board computer of the satellite, or the master of the communication bus, and the slave is the generic fine sun sensor device.

Every command sent to the sensor shall comply with the format below:
- Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes) - Synchronization word that indicates the start of a new frame.
- Command Code = 0xXX (1 byte) - Corresponds to the code of the incoming command.
- Length = 0x01 (1 byte) - For commands it is fixed to 0x01.
- Checksum = 0xXX (1 byte) - For command 0x01, the value of the checksum field is 0x02.

Every response sent to the master shall comply with the format described below:
- Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes) - Synchronization word that indicates the start of a new frame.
- Command Code = 0xXX (1 byte) - Corresponds to the code of the command which this response refers to.
- Length = 0xXX (1 byte) - The sum of the number of bytes of the fields "Application Data" and "Checksum".
- Application Data = 0xXX ... 0xXX (2-16 bytes) - The response with the data requested by the corresponding command.
- Checksum = 0xXX (1 byte) - Used to check the integrity of the packet.  It is calculated by adding all bytes in "Command Code", "Length", and "Application Data" fields and extracting the least significant byte of the result.
    - E.g. Successful calculation of angular position with angles alpha = 5 degrees (0x40 A0 00 00) and beta = 10 degrees (0x41 20 00 00)
        - DE AD BE EF 01 0A 40 A0 00 00 41 20 00 00 00 
        - 01 + 0A + 40 + A0 + 00 + 00 + 41 + 20 + 00 + 00 + 00 = 0x14C.  Least significant byte of 0x14C is 0x4C.
        - So checksum is 0x4C

### SPI Protocol Format
The following describes an example of a command/response communication for command code 0x01 via SPI.  Note that the IDLE byte value is 0xFF:

- SPI Request:
    - On board computer to generic fine sun sensor device:
        - Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes)
        - Command Code - 0x01 (1 byte)
        - Length = 0x01 (1 byte)
        - Checksum = 0x02 (1 byte)
    - Generic fine sun sensor device to on board computer:
        - Idle message = IDLE x 7 (7 bytes)
- SPI Response:
    - On board computer to generic fine sun sensor device:
        - Idle message = IDLE x 16 (16 bytes)
    - Generic fine sun sensor device to on board computer:
        - Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes)
        - Command Code = 0x01 (1 byte)
        - Length = 0x0A (1 byte)
        - Application Data
            - Angle alpha = 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX (float, 4 bytes)
            - Angle beta = 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX (float, 4 bytes)
            - Error code = 0xXX (1 byte)
        - Checksum = 0xXX (1 byte)

### Commands
The command codes implemented are:
- Command Code = 0x01, Name = Angular position, Functionality = Request for the angular position (alpha, beta) and the error code.

#### Command 0x01:  Angular position
Request for the angular position and corresponding error code.  The two angles which determine the angular position (alpha and beta, see above) are represented by a single-precision floating-point format.  The error code is represented in a char.
- Command
    - Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes)
    - Command Code = 0x01 (1 byte)
    - Length = 0x01 (1 byte)
    - Checksum = 0x02 (1 byte)

- Response
    - Sync Word = 0xDEADBEEF (4 bytes)
    - Command Code = 0x01 (1 byte)
    - Length = 0x0A (1 byte)
    - Application Data:
        - Angle alpha = 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX (float, 4 bytes)
        - Angle beta = 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX (float, 4 bytes)
        - Error code = 0xXX (1 byte)
    - Checksum = 0xXX (1 byte)

Error codes:
- 0 = No error.  Angles were calculated successfully.
- 1 = Error.  Sun not in field of view or earth albedo affected measurement.

# Software Configuration

## Flight Software
Refer to the file [fsw/platform_inc/generic_fss_platform_cfg.h](fsw/platform_inc/generic_fss_platform_cfg.h) for the default configuration settings to the component hardware bus, as well as a summary on overriding parameters in mission-specific repositories.  In addition, to build the flight software, the component must be listed in the ```APPLICATION_LIST``` setting of the cFS ```targets.cmake``` file (typically in a ```*_defs``` directory).  Also, to run the FSS app as part of the flight software, the component must be listed in the cFE startup script (```*.scr```) file (also typically found in a ```*_defs``` directory).  A typical line to add the FSS app looks like:

```
CFE_APP, /cf/generic_fss.so,            GENERIC_FSS_AppMain,      FSS,              60, 8192,  0x0, 0;
```

For more information on the format, please refer to the cFE startup script (```*.scr```) file.


## Simulator
Refer to the file [sim/cfg/nos3-fss-simulator.xml](sim/cfg/nos3-fss-simulator.xml) for the default configuration settings.  Note that the block of XML within this file should be placed within the `<simulators></simulators>` section of the main ```nos3-simulator.xml``` configuration file which is read by the ```sim_common code``` and used by the simulator.  For more information, refer to the example configuration file in ```nos3/sims/cfg/nos3-simulator.xml```.

## 42
The ```GENERIC_FSS_42_PROVIDER``` simulation data provider depends on receiving data for a fine sun sensor over a TCP/IP socket (specified in the simulator configuration) from the 42 spacecraft simulator.  To provide this data, 42 must be configured with a fine sun sensor block in the 42 spacecraft configuration file (typically named to begin with ```SC_``` but whose name is ultimately specified in the Spacecraft section of the 42 ```Inp_Sim.txt``` file).  Refer to the file [sim/cfg/SC_fss_NOS3.txt](sim/cfg/SC_fss_NOS3.txt) for what this configuration block should look like.  This block should be placed within the `************************* Fine Sun Sensor *******************************` section of the ```SC_*.xml``` configuration file which is read by 42 for spacecraft information.  For more information, refer to the example 42 spacecraft configuration file in ```nos3/sims/cfg/InOut/SC_NOS3.txt```.

In addition, the 42 ```Inp_IPC.txt``` configuration file must specify information about the TCP/IP socket connection to the simulation data provider.  Refer to the file [sim/cfg/Inp_fss_IPC.txt](sim/cfg/Inp_fss_IPC.txt) for what this configuration block should look like.  This block should be placed in the ```Inp_IPC.txt``` configuration file which is read by 42 for IPC information.  For more information, refer to the example 42 spacecraft configuration file in ```nos3/sims/cfg/InOut/Inp_IPC.txt```.

Important for communication with the simulation provider:
- The ```IPC Mode``` must be ```TX```
- The ```Socket Role``` must be ```SERVER```
- The ```Server Host Name, Port``` must be specified and match the setting in the simulator XML configuration file
- ```Allow Blocking``` must be ```FALSE```
- ```Prefix```(es) must be set based on the data to send from 42 and based on what is expected to be parsed by the simulation data provider

To get a better understanding of the data that can be provided by 42, try running 42 with ```Echo to stdout``` set to ```TRUE```, 1 ```TX``` prefix, and a prefix of ```SC```.  If you then run 42, the main terminal window will echo the data being sent out from 42 to the TCP/IP socket.  You can then choose the prefix(es) to filter out and determine how to parse the 42 data in the simulation data provider (or the data point that provides the interface between the simulation data provider and the simulation hardware model).
